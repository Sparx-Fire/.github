  ## 🚀 What We're Building

  We're developing **intelligent fire protection systems** that combine
   sensors, software, and wireless communication for early fire
  detection and coordinated sprinkler response.

  With our patent-pending **Sparx Smart Sprinkler System**, we're
  aiming for:

  - ⚡ **Faster fire response** through integrated electronics
  - 🎯 **Precision water delivery** for water-sensitive environments
  - 📊 **Real-time diagnostics** and system health visibility
  - 🔗 **Wireless coordination** between devices

  *Currently in prototype stage — we're actively developing and
  refining our technology.*

  ## 🛠️ Open Source & AI Tools

  Our system is being designed to understand the building it protects —
   sprinkler locations, room geometry, and device relationships. To
  prototype and test that kind of spatial awareness, we need to
  generate building models fast and iterate without friction.

  **Revit MCP** (Model Context Protocol) connects an AI assistant
  directly to Autodesk Revit, letting us describe what we want in plain
   language and build it. Instead of manual modeling, we can quickly
  generate layouts, place sprinklers, and extract the spatial data our
  releasing panel is being designed to work with.
